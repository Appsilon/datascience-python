# Pandas

This directory contains introduction to types of data used in data science/machine learning followed by the introductory tutorial to `pandas` - the go-to library for dataframes in python.

As a bonus I present ways to do the homework in `polars`.

In this one notebook I covered only the very basics of data wrangling in `pandas`.
If you want to get a more detailed course regarding this manner I highly recommend [Minimalist Data Wrangling with Python](https://datawranglingpy.gagolewski.com/) book by Marek GÄ…golewski!
It is available for free for everyone.
