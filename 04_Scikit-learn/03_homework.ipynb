    "\n",
    "1. `housing_train.csv` - training data\n",
    "2. `housing_validation.csv` - validation data, you will evaluate your model on this data\n",
    "3. `housing_example_submission.csv` - example submission of your model\n",
    "\n",
    "You will split your work into two parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Train a simple linear regression model\n",
    "\n",
    "First make the following preprocessing on the whole `housing_train.csv`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Columns with more than 70% of `NA` values change into columns `NA_in_col_*` by following instructions in the presentation part. **Remove the original column**.\n",
    "2. Fill the rest of `NA`s in other columns with the **median** of particular column.\n",
    "\n",
    "With such dataframe train the linear regression model that will predict the `MEDV` column.\n",
    "Using this model answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Predict the price of the observation `rec` (defined bellow).\n",
    "2. How much would the prediction change if we'd increase the `RM` column by 2?"
