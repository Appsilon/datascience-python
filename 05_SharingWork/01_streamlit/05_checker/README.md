# Homework checker

This app has been designed to check the prediction part of homework from the previous week!
Run it and upload your predictions.

The design allows running on some server with multiple users connecting and uploading their results.

## Running checker

The database already contains LightGBM model result, if you want to create a clean database run the `create_db.py` script.
You can run the app with `streamlit run main.py`.
