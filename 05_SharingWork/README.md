# Streamlit, Quarto, FastAPI

We've reached the final lecture ðŸŽ‰ of this course.

We've learned a planty of things, but it's high time we show our results to the world.
To do so I present 3 libraries that focus on different approaches.

### Streamlit

The new, yet already feature-full library for creating interactive dashboards of your analysis.
Dashboard may present some plots, data from dataframes, simulation results or predictions from an ML model.
What is remarkable about `streamlit` is the easy with which you can create those dashboards.
Check out examples.

### Quarto 

Library that created `html` files with course materials from `qmd` and `ipynb` files.
You can also create technical $\\LaTeX$-like reports using `quarto` as shown here.
Technically speaking its the language-agnostic successor of Rmarkdown.

### FastAPI

Not always results of our analysis will be presented to other people, sometimes they'll be consumed by another service/machine.
If that's your use case, there is no easier to use library to create REST api in Python than `fastapi`.
