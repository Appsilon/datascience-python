# Plots

This directory contains notebook with examples of plotting in python.
We cover two libraries `matplotlib` and `plotly.express`.

## `matplotlib`

This library is usually used if you need a quick, dead-simple plot or a plot that will be exported to pdf.
Lot's and lot's of [tutorials available for `matplotlib` online](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/index.html).

## `plotly.express`

This is [sugar-syntaxed version of the `plotly` library](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/).
In a very simple way you can create interactive and visually appealing plots for data from data frames.
